        <p>Dear kira,</p>
        <p style="font-size: small; align-self:center;">

            From the moment you walked into my life, everything changed in the most beautiful way. You have become the center of my universe, the person I turn to for comfort, joy, and love. Your presence in my life is like a beacon of light, guiding me through the darkest times and illuminating my happiest moments. I often find myself reflecting on how incredibly fortunate I am to have you by my side. Your love and support have been unwavering, and I cannot imagine a single day without you.
            
            You are my confidant, my best friend, and my greatest love. Every conversation we share, every laugh, and every tear has brought us closer together, weaving a tapestry of memories that I hold dear. Your kindness, compassion, and understanding have shown me what true love really means. You have a way of making me feel seen and heard, even when I struggle to express myself. Your patience and empathy are boundless, and I am constantly in awe of your ability to make everything better just by being there.
            
            Life with you is an adventure, filled with unexpected joys and cherished moments. Whether we are exploring new places, enjoying a quiet evening at home, or simply talking about our dreams and aspirations, every moment with you is precious. You have taught me to appreciate the little things, to find beauty in the mundane, and to cherish the time we have together. Your love has given me the strength to face challenges and the courage to pursue my dreams.
            
            I cannot imagine my life without you. The thought of waking up without you by my side, of not hearing your voice or seeing your smile, is unbearable. You are the person I want to share my life with, to grow old with, and to build a future with. Your love is the foundation upon which I build my hopes and dreams. You have become an integral part of who I am, and I am forever grateful for the love and happiness you bring into my life.
            
            Every day, I am reminded of how lucky I am to have you. Your love is a gift that I cherish more than anything else in this world. You have shown me what it means to be truly loved and to love in return. I promise to always be there for you, to support you, and to love you with all my heart. You are my everything, and I cannot imagine a life without you. Thank you for being you, for loving me, and for making my life so incredibly beautiful.
            
            
        <p>
            With all my love,<br>
